#Unit Tests
#This tests specific methods and logic in the code. This is the most granular type of test.
#The goal is to verify the internal flow of the method, as well as to make sure edge cases are being handled.

def test_func():

#Feature Tests
#This tests the functionality of the component. A collection of unit tests 
#may or may not represent a Feature test. The goal is to verify the component meets 
#the requirements given for it. If you're thinking in terms of a work item, 
#this would be testing a ticket as a whole.

#Integration Tests
#This tests the entire application, end to end. The goal is to guarantee 
#the stability of the application. When new code is added, integration tests 
#should still pass with minimal effort.

#Performance Tests
#This tests the efficiency of a piece of code. The size of the code being tested
#can range from a method to the whole application.
